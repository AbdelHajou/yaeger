Yaeger (Yet Another Education Game Engine Runtime) is a fully functional 2D game-engine that 
requires only a traditional Object Oriented style of programming. It is based on JavaFX and 
requires Java 12 or above to work.

## Versioning

Because Yaeger will be used in an educational context, versioning will be based on school years.
Thus version 2020.2021 will be used during the school year that start in September 2020 and ends in July 2021.

### Breaking changes
It is likely that the API will break between different versions
